# DrawingTool
This is from a project from a colloboration. This project is more then it appears: there were 4 phases prior to the implementation itself: Project Development, Requirement Analysis, Design Modeling, and Testing.
There were domain, sequence, and design diagrams. The collaboration also performed all of this under the scrum process model.

The project itself is a painting application that let's you draw on a canvas that has the width and height of whatever you set it to be. You can also log in and use an image as a background. You can change your color and brush. Lastly, you can save your progress and come back to your image later.


I may come back and make some improvements on this.
