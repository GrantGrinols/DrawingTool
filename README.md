# DrawingTool
This is from a project from a colloboration. This project is more then it appears: there were 4 phases prior to the implementation itself: Project Development, Requirement Analysis, Design Modeling, and Testing.
There were domain, sequence, and design diagrams. The collaboration also performed all of this under the scrum process model. Email me for elaboration about these 4 phases.
